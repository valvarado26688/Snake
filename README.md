This is a basic snake game made with the purpose of experimenting with HTML Canvas.
there are a few things I need to impove on the game itself:
* the snake can travel inside its own body
* sometimes the snake seems to collide with the wall before visually hitting the wall

  GOALS:

  Continue impoving the game over time and have fun
